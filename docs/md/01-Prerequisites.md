This tutorial assumes that you are already comfortable with the basics of React, and that you have already created a number of interactive apps with a single focus. In particular, I expect you to know about:

* [Components](https://react.dev/reference/react/Component)
* [Promises](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)
* [Contexts, Providers](https://react.dev/learn/passing-data-deeply-with-context) and [Reducers](https://react.dev/reference/react/useReducer)

If any of these concepts are unfamiliar to you, please follow the links provided before you continue.

## Development environment and local server

I also assume that you are working with an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) like VS Code, which allows you to open HTML files using an extension like Live Server. This means that I can separate the code you'll be writing into different files, each with a single purpose.

You can download these files from [here](https://github.com/MERNCraft/Lazy-Loading-Sandbox).
