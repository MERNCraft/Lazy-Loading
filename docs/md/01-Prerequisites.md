This tutorial assumes that you are already comfortable with the basics of React, and that you have already created a number of interactive apps with a single focus. In particular, I expect you to know about:

* Components
* Promises


I also assume that you are working with an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) like VS Code, which allows you to open HTML files using an extension like Live Server. This means that I can separate the code you'll be writing into different files, each with a single purpose.

<summary>Plan B</summary>
If you don't have the luxury of a local server, I do provide an alternative _standalone.html_ file for each topic that I want to illustrate. You can open directly in your browser with a double-click, and they do contain the same code as the separate files that I discuss in more detail.
